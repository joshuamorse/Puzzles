Dynamic Numbers
===============

Let's call a number "increasing" if, going from left to right, no digit has a smaller value than one to its left.

Let's call a number "decreasing" if, going from left to right, no digit has a larger value than one to its left.

If a number is neither, let's call it "dynamic".

Example: "1233389" is increasing, "99610" is decreasing, and "1482" is dynamic.

Now let's look at the proportion of numbers that are dynamic. The smallest dynamic number is 101, so the proportion for 100 is 0%. As you go higher, the proportion increases. For example, the proportion for 175 is 20%.

Find the smallest number for which the proportion is exactly 99%.
